# N Queens Problem
Overview: This code solves N Queens problem with Backtracking algorithm, Hill Climbing Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm 
Respectively even in case of extremely large dimensions of the problem.

Project Structure:

How to Execute:
Run main.py
- provide the number of queens "N"
All the 3 algorithms(Backtracking, Hill Climbing and Genetic) will display solution to the entered no of queen.

Ex:
run main.py
Enter No Of Queens -- 4
