How to Execute:
Run main.py
- provide the number of queens "N"
All the 3 algorithms(Backtracking, Hill Climbing and Genetic) will display solution to the entered no of queen.

Ex:
run main.py
Enter No Of Queens -- 4

OUTPUT:
************** N-Queen Problem With Backtracking Algorithm ****************** 
The Total Time take for solving 4 queens is: --- 0.0009989738464355469 seconds 
Maximum fitness for 4 queens is 6.0
